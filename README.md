nonogram solver in python based on CPMpy (OR-tools under the hood)

# Basic usage

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). No setup is
necessary once you have uv, just invoke `uv run` and you're off to go.

Find a puzzle on [Web Paint-By-Number](https://webpbn.com/). Grab the
ID of the puzzle off the end of the URL.

Run `get_nonogram` to fetch a copy of the puzzle to your local disk,
where the number at the end is the ID of the puzzle you grabbed in the
previous step:

```bash
uv run get_nonogram 1
```

This will create an XML file in the `puzzles` directory.

Run `solve_nonogram` to solve a nonogram:

```bash
uv run solve_nonogram puzzles/1.xml
```

# Other tools

Run `benchmark_nonogram` to solve each puzzle in the `puzzles/`
directory and report the runtime in csv.

```bash
uv run benchmark_nonogram
```

Run `random_nonogram` to generate random nonograms, solve them, and
tally up the resulting statistics. Nonograms are generated by randomly
filling each cell with probability `p` between `p_min` and `p_max`.

```bash
uv run random_nonogram --p_min 
```

# Current limitations

Can only handle monochrome (black-and-white) puzzles, no color support
yet.

Can only accept puzzles in the XML format that webpbn xml format.

# Acknowledgments

Thanks to webpbn and its users for providing the problem instances in
the `puzzles/` directory. Having a set of instances whose designers
have given permission for redistribution makes this project a lot
easier.
